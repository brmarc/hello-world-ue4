# Hello World Starter

## Lets begin our UE4 journey

This is a Markdown file.  This is a format that is more basic than HTML that allows you to do a bit of formatting with a very simple syntax.  For more information to the Markdown [Website](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax).

Every project needs a README file and it should clearly explain the project that you are working on.  This will show up in your main entry to your github page.  Remember for headings use the `#`, `##` as heading and subheading.  So the title of this page would be written as `# Hello World Starter`.

The only other file included is a .gitignore which is compatible with version **4.18.2** of **Unreal**.

For bullet points you can use `*` for example: `* This is a bullet`:
* This is a bullet

Or for numbered lists, you can use `1.` for example: `1.  This is a numbered list`:
1.  This is a numbered list
